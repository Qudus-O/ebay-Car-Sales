# ebay-Car-Sales
The dataset I analyzed includes more than 20,000 individual entries related to car sales on eBay. To ensure the data was reliable and useful, I performed comprehensive data exploration and cleaning using the powerful pandas and NumPy libraries in Python. 

During my analysis, I focused on examining the prices of cars categorized by their respective brands, revealing a total of 40 distinct car brands represented in the dataset. Interestingly, I found that four of the five brands with the highest sales volumes are manufactured by German companies. Among these brands, Volkswagen stands out as the most prominent and recognized, reflecting its strong presence in the automotive market. This exploration allowed for deeper insights into pricing trends across different brands and highlighted the dominance of German manufacturers within the dataset.
